1. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. 
What is the probability that both children are boys?

Solution:
There are 3 possible cases: { (boy,boy), (boy, girl), (girl, boy) }
If both children are boys => P = 1/3

2. Cards of the Same Suit

You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. 
What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

SOlution:
There are 13 suits in a deck.
After drawing a card, there left 12 other cards which are of the same suit of the 1st card.
=> Prob. of the 1st card = 52
Prob. of the 2nd card = 12

If you just draw randomly 2 cards from a deck => prob. = 52*51

=> result = 52*12/(52*51) = 12/51

3. Drawing Marbles

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Solution:
After the 1st red marbles, we are left with 6 marbles in which 4 of them are blue.
=> 4/6 = 2/3
